# Goal of the project
We are trying to make the creating and editing of World of Warcraft macros easier for their players. The goal is to create a visually appealing way to create these macro's, but also validate any choices that are made by the end user. In the end, they should end up with a macro that they can easily copy paste into their game.

# Constraints
Some constraints to work with:

- We are mainly focused on .NET development, using Blazor for the website.
- We will have to make sure we test the macro's we can make through the website, through unit tests.
