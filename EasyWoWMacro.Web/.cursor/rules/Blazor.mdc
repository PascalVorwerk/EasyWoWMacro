- Read up on the @docs Blazor Render modes and @docs Blazor JS interop, using the latest Blazor features from .NET 9
- We always work with a Blazor web app template, never a standalone WASM app.
- We use code behind files wherever possible.
- Split up large components into smaller components when it feels needed.
